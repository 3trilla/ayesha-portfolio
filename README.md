### About Me
I build AI systems that actually ship. My flagship project is the **Virtual Teaching Assistant (VTA)** for UT Tyler, deployed on the UT System‚Äôs private cloud. It runs directly on professors‚Äô notes with guardrails to ensure secure, accurate answers and includes dashboards for faculty to understand student trends. I also built the **Noodle Agent** during my internship at Noodle Seed,an agent that remembers context, supports voice interactions, summarizes conversations, and connects users to humans when needed.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### 1) Virtual Teaching Assistant (VTA)
Built for The University of Texas at Tyler; deployed on the UT System‚Äôs private cloud.

- **What it does:**  
  - Answers using professors‚Äô source notes (guardrails prevent drift).  
  - **Students:** Acts as a teaching assistant.  
  - **Faculty:** Reveals where students struggle and trends across classes.  
  - **Pilot study:** Launching soon.  
- **My role:** Developed from the ground up (architecture, retrieval pipeline, dashboards).

**Tech:** FastAPI ‚Ä¢ React ‚Ä¢ PostgreSQL + pgvector ‚Ä¢ **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** ‚Ä¢ Docker ‚Ä¢ NGINX

**Key snippet (Python)**

```python
# Simplified retrieval: pgvector cosine similarity
def retrieve(conn, q_embed, k=5):
    rows = conn.execute(
        """
        SELECT chunk, 1 - (embedding <=> :q) AS score
        FROM documents
        ORDER BY embedding <=> :q
        LIMIT :k
        """,
        {"q": q_embed, "k": k},
    ).fetchall()
    return [dict(r) for r in rows]
```

### 2) Noodle Agent (Noodle Seed)
Deployed on Fly.dev; planned integration into the company website.

- **What it does:**  
  - Human-like conversations with **context memory** across sessions.  
  - **Voice-to-text** & **text-to-voice**.  
  - Summarizes conversations and can route users to a human.  
- **My role:** Agent behaviors, voice loop, context management, deployment.

**Tech:** Next.js ‚Ä¢ Supabase ‚Ä¢ Voice Agents ‚Ä¢ WebSocket
