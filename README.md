### About Me
I build AI systems that actually ship. My flagship project is the **Virtual Teaching Assistant (VTA)** for UT Tyler, deployed on the UT System‚Äôs private cloud. It runs directly on professors‚Äô notes with guardrails to ensure secure, accurate answers and includes dashboards for faculty to understand student trends. I also built the **Noodle Agent** during my internship at Noodle Seed,an agent that remembers context, supports voice interactions, summarizes conversations, and connects users to humans when needed.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### 1) Virtual Teaching Assistant (VTA)
Built for The University of Texas at Tyler; deployed on the UT System‚Äôs private cloud.

- **What it does:**  
  - Answers using professors‚Äô source notes (guardrails prevent drift).  
  - **Students:** Acts as a teaching assistant.  
  - **Faculty:** Reveals where students struggle and trends across classes.  
  - **Pilot study:** Launching soon.  
- **My role:** Developed from the ground up (architecture, retrieval pipeline, dashboards).

**Tech:** FastAPI ‚Ä¢ React ‚Ä¢ PostgreSQL + pgvector ‚Ä¢ **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** ‚Ä¢ Docker ‚Ä¢ NGINX

<!-- Sentiment analysis workflow -->
**The next two images, captured during the development phase, demonstrate testing of a sentiment analysis workflow: initially classifying each student query (positive/negative/neutral), later redesigned to comply with FERPA by aggregating sentiment at the topic level rather than per student**

****Key snippet (Python)** snippet (Python)**

```python
# Simplified retrieval: pgvector cosine similarity
def retrieve(conn, q_embed, k=5):
    rows = conn.execute(
        """
        SELECT chunk, 1 - (embedding <=> :q) AS score
        FROM documents
        ORDER BY embedding <=> :q
        LIMIT :k
        """,
        {"q": q_embed, "k": k},
    ).fetchall()
    return [dict(r) for r in rows]
```

### 2) Noodle Agent (Noodle Seed)
Deployed on Fly.dev; planned integration into the company website.

- **What it does:**  
  - Human-like conversations with **context memory** across sessions.  
  - **Voice-to-text** & **text-to-voice**.  
  - Summarizes conversations and can route users to a human.  
- **My role:** Agent behaviors, voice loop, context management, deployment.

**Tech:** Next.js ‚Ä¢ Supabase ‚Ä¢ Voice Agents ‚Ä¢ WebSocket

### üîí Note on Private Work
Most of my professional projects are hosted in private organization repositories and cannot be shared publicly due to confidentiality.  
To give recruiters and collaborators an overview of my skills, I‚Äôve included selected highlights, screenshots, code snippets, and project summaries in this portfolio.

If you‚Äôd like to learn more about my work with:

- **Virtual Teaching Assistant (VTA)** ‚Äî AI-driven education platform deployed on UT System‚Äôs private cloud
- **Noodle Agent** ‚Äî real-time voice-enabled AI assistant deployed at Noodle Seed

I‚Äôm happy to discuss the technical details, architecture, and outcomes during interviews or by request.
